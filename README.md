# Steel Collective
This website is created for a steelband. The aim of the band is to approach and represent a more professional small scale market; intended for smaller professional events such as weddings, birthdays or garden parties. The closed band acts as part of an portfolio to get to really know the individuals not only as a band but also as working professionals that have other projects we promote individually.
The concept of this website is to delve deeper into the individuals as people as well as a collective. The aim is for the audience to gain a personal relationship that is unique and individual as oppose to being generic and single-layered. 

## UX
The main purpose is to promote the band with the intention of giving an insight into different/in-depth aspects of the band.

I wanted to create a website that showcased the project of the band and give the audience a deeper understanding of that band that isn’t as possible on other media platforms. I wanted to ensure that it was attractive to the eye encouraging people to see the professionalism of the band and book for gigs such as weddings, awards/special occasions,

###Browsers and screen sizes.
*I ran the site continuously on Google Chrome on a large screen and the site generally ran how I imagined it to look. 
*When tested site on Microsoft Edge using a larger screen the site had similar results with no noticeable changes. 
*One problem that occurs is the book online section where the header lines are not centred. 
*Another slight issue is one of the photos used in the slider that is very zoomed in and doesn’t’ give the same representation on a larger screen. 
*The gallery page when tested on my Iphone 8 was quite short and doesn’t have the feature of being able to click into the picture to get a larger view. 
*Many of the items you click on the page refresh the page and bring you back to the top which is a slight inconvenience as links will be added in the future. 
*From 1200px to 1330px the header seems to collect on top of each other.

###Bugs I had: 
Website was showing 
1.The photos in the carousel were squashed and to resolve I used the “object-fit: cover;” function so the images don’t look squashed and fill the entire space.
2.I found that none of the styling elements were working despite many trials to eventually find that the style-sheet was not correctly added in the header. 
3. In the header I noticed that the carousel was not working. After close inspection I found that “carousel-Inidicators” was spelt wrong. This was not enabling the carousel to move. Re-spelt the word ‘Indicators’ and the slider began to work.
